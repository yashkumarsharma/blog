2: Who Eats the Core of Kapittha (Wood Apple) and Jambu (Rose Apple) Fruits,

<pre>
Gajananam Bhoota Ganadi Sevitam; 
Kapittha Jambu phalasara bhakshitam; 
Umasutam Shoka Vinasha karanam; 
Namami Vighneswara pada pankajam;
</pre>


“Oh Elephant-faced, worshiped by the existing beings, of all living beings, tasting the elephant apple (kaith) and jambolana (jamun), the Son of Uma, destroyer of grief, I bow to the lotus feet of Ganesha who is lord of all.”

b.  Or  Gajananam ( the big tummy one worshipped by all) Bhoota (Durva grass and Bilva patra used for worshipping Ganesha) Ganadi ( in equal quantity)  Sevitam (if consumed); Kapittha (Kaith ) Jambu ( Jamun) phalasara (fruits)  bhakshitam (to be consumed); Umasutam ( son of Uma) Shoka ( diseases) Vinasha karanam (get rid of); Namami ( I bow to ) Vighneswara ( destroyer of grief) pada pankajam ( feet of lord)”

 The mantra talks about four medicinal herbs: Durva grass and Bilva patra ( Bel leaves) used for Ganesha worship; fruit of elephant apple (Kaith) and fruit of Jambolona ( or Jamun). All four have anti diabetic properties and can be mixed in equal quantity and prepared as a medicinal juice.

 Medically Durva grass (Cynodon dactylon) has been shown to possess anti diabetic, cholesterol owering, immune-modulatory, DNA protective, aphrodisiac, male fertility, anti cancer and anti inflammatory activities. Similarly Bilva Patra has both anti diabetic and fertility promoting properties.

 Elephant apple (Limonia acidissima) also named as Wood Apple, Elephant Apple, Monkey Fruit, Curd Fruit, Koth Bel, Kaitha  and Kath Bel, has been shown to possess strong anti diabetic properties.

 Jamun (Syzygium cumini) also has DNA protective, anti oxidant and anti diabetic properties and is an essential ingredient of most anti diabetic Ayurveda preparations.

Worth trying: To prevent diabetes and to reduce the ill effects of metabolic syndrome regularly take equal mixed quantity of Durva grass, Kaith fruit and Jamun fruit juices.
